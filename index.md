Remember that as a **political activist of any kind**, you are at high risk. The guidelines below are intended to protect you against the kind of threats we have seen historically. They are ranked in rough descending order of priority.


The good news is, if you follow these guidelines, you will have a high level of protection against being [‘Podesta-ed’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails). The easiest way to get this protection is to form good security habits before you need them.


Please don’t hesitate to contact us with questions.

## Updates

By far the most important piece of advice we can give is: keep all your software up to date.

Turn on auto-updates on your phone and laptop, and don’t wait to apply them.

## Anti-Virus

Keep your Anti-Virus up to date. **Do not *ever* attempt use pirated antivirus software.**

If your antivirus is set up by your employer, leave the settings as-is. 

Given the choice, on your personal Windows 10 computer use Windows Defender. It is free and outperforms almost all commercial antivirus software. [Follow instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/turn-on-defender-windows)

Mac's do not need any antivirus installed to set up; it is built in to macOS.

## Email

Your personal email account holds the keys to your online life, and will be the primary target for attackers. Use Gmail for your personal email, and Chrome as your web browser.

Don’t have sensitive conversations over email. Use WhatsApp (see below).

Don’t give any apps permissions to read or write your email inbox.

Make sure your email is protected with by multi factor authentication. 

**We highly recommend you set up Google Advanced Protection**; [follow the instructions here](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/). In order to do this you will need two Security Keys; [these cost around £20](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Security-Key-USB-Authentication/dp/B07BYSB7FK/)

Otherwise, use app-based multi factor authentication; [click here and follow this guide](https://authy.com/guides/gmail/)

## Attachments

Attachments are one of the biggest risks you face. Even attachments  coming from a trusted sender are a danger; if someone you know gets 
their email hacked, the attacker may send you a message that looks just like a typical message, but actually contains a malicious payload (for example, an email from your campaign manager with a Word doc that actually installs a virus).

Here is the hierarchy of attachment safety, from safest to most risky:

1. Safest is to open them on an iPhone
1. Save them directly to Google Drive from Gmail. If you hover over an attachment in Gmail, you’ll see a ‘save in Google Drive’ icon. Open them in Google Drive
1. Download them to disk, and upload them to Google Drive in your browser.  Make sure you delete the downloaded file, so you don’t accidentally double-click it in the future.

The least safe way to open an attachment is to double-click it on your laptop.  **Never do this.**

## Sharing Files

Get out of the habit of sending attachments. Instead, send links to a Google document.

Don’t use file sharing services like Dropbox or Evernote. Stick to Google Drive.

## Phone

Given the choice, use an iPhone over Android.

Uninstall apps you are not regularly using; if you need them again you can always reinstall them.

Limit apps' permissions to the minimum possible. If an app asks for lots of unexplained permissions, uninstall it (do you really want a flashlight app that needs access to your camera, messages & contacts?)

Make sure you have at least a 4-digit key code or passphrase (6 digits is better; the number of possible codes goes from 10,000 to 1,000,000!) Avoid using dates in your passcode.

### iPhone

Your phone needs to be receiving software updates from its manufacturer; at publication all iPhones newer than model 6 meet this.

Your iPhone is the most secure device you have. Do whatever work you can on it. It is always better to read email, use Signal, and surf the web on your phone.

TouchID/FaceID is safe to use, but Siri is not. Siri can reveal information about your contacts even when the phone is locked.

### Android:

Your phone *needs* to be receiving software updates from its manufacturer.

**Do not sideload apps**. This bypasses many security protections Google put in place to protect Android phones, and is a HUGE infection vector.

## Passwords

We strongly recommend you install and use a password manager. [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) offers a free version which lets you generate secure passwords and share them securely between your devices.

Don’t reuse the same passwords (or similar passwords) across sites. It is better to keep a list of random passwords in a text file or Word document than it is to re-use passwords.

If you can remember your password, it is likely not strong enough.

Any clever scheme you use to remember your passwords can be cracked within minutes by modern techniques. Pick truly random passwords 
instead, and save them in a password manager like LastPass.

Move all your critical account passwords (email/Facebook/Twitter/etc.) to LastPass stored/generated ones. Progressively move other accounts over to 1password as you log in to them naturally.

## Laptop

Remember that your phone is always more secure than your laptop.

If you have a Windows laptop, make sure it’s running Windows 10.

Enable full disk encryption:

#### If you have Windows 10 Home:

Go to: Start > Settings > System > About

Look for the “Device encryption” setting at the bottom of the About pane. If it’s not there, your computer does not support the limited encryption feature that Home supports.

#### If you have Windows 10 Pro:

Right-click on Start > Control Panel > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Turn on BitLocker

If it says you don’t have a TPM, here’s how to use BitLocker without a TPM.

#### If you have a Mac:

[click here and follow this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837)

If possible, consider getting a Chromebook. This is a simplified computer, far more secure than an ordinary laptop, that can only run the Chrome browser.

Never put USB drives (flash drives) in your computer. This is an extremely common attack route. Plugging anything into a USB port is high risk.

## Text Messages

Use WhatsApp for sending text messages, and for group chat.

**Avoid SMS (regular text messages)** or iMessage for private messaging. If you must use Facebook Messenger, make sure to turn on private conversations.

Treat Twitter and Slack as a public forum,  even if you use their private message features.

## Facebook

Turn on two-factor auth in Facebook. If you have a security key (£20, see above) [click here and follow this guide](https://techsolidarity.org/resources/security_key_facebook.htm)

Otherwise, [click here and follow this guide]( https://authy.com/guides/facebook/) for app-based MFA:

Take your phone number off your Facebook account.

## Twitter

Assume that anything you say in Twitter direct messages will one day be public.

If you have a security key (see above), [click here and follow this guide](https://techsolidarity.org/resources/security_key_twitter.html)

Otherwise, [click here and follow this guide](https://authy.com/guides/twitter/)


## Browser

Use Google Chrome as your default browser on your laptop.

On your iPhone, use Safari.

On your Android, use Chrome.

Install and use the [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en) Chrome browser extensions.  Avoid using other extensions, as they have access to your browsing activity .

Make a habit of using incognito mode.

If you are visiting websites that you feel are particularly dodgy, consider using a Chromebook for the purpose, or your phone.


## Slack

It’s fine to use Slack for coordinating and organizing, but be mindful of the conversations you have there. Move private discussions to Whatsapp.

## Wi-Fi

If you do not own the Wi-Fi (e.g. you are in a cafe or hotel), then you shouldn't trust it.


**Do not use Wi-Fi you cannot trust**. 

If you must get online, use your mobile phone's 4G connection instead - browse directly from the mobile phone, or create a Wi-Fi hotspot which you can connect your other device to. *Use a long password for any Wi-Fi hotspots you create.*


## Getting Help

If you need help, or feel out of your depth, or there are mysterious white vans outside your campaign HQ, contact us! We’ll do our best to connect you to security experts who can give you additional training.

Our goal is to help keep you safe without overwhelming you. If you found this training valuable, please spread the word to others. We can even try to send nerds to train anyone, anywhere!
