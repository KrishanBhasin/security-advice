Remember that as a **political activist of any kind**, you are at high risk. The guidelines below are intended to protect you against the kind of threats we have seen historically. They are ranked in rough descending order of priority.


The good news is, if you follow these guidelines, you will have a high level of protection against being [‘Podesta-ed’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails). The easiest way to get this protection is to form good security habits before you need them.


Please don’t hesitate to contact us with questions.

# How to use this Guide
This guide is intended to contain a list of easy-to-follow activities.

- The bullet points are direct actions you can take

Other text is extra information or useful context. If you are in a rush, feel free to only follow the bullet points.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/programs/digital-security) has a very useful 7 day guide that walks you through many actions that overlap with this guide, but with an additional focus on privacy. It is a well written guide, and a great way to spread out what can seem like an overwhelming amount of advice into managable 15 minute chunks over the course of a week.

You may wish to register for the 7 day guide, and go through it, using this webpage as a reference to come back to in the future.

It runs as follows:
- Day 1: Set Up a Password Manager
- Day 2: Check Your Smartphone's Privacy Ssettings
- Day 3: Protect Your Browsing
- Day 4: Protect Your Laptop

# Securing your online presence
This section will suffice for most people; if you are interested in going further (security is a gradient, not an absolute - you can always do more) then feel free to read the `Going Further` section. 

## Updates

By far the most important piece of advice we can give is: keep all your software up to date.

- Turn on auto-updates on your phone and laptop, and don’t wait to apply them.

## Anti-Virus

- Keep your Anti-Virus up to date. **Do not *ever* attempt use pirated antivirus software.**

- If your antivirus is set up by your employer, leave the settings as-is.

Given the choice, on your personal Windows 10 computer use Windows Defender. It is free and outperforms almost all commercial antivirus software. [Follow instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/turn-on-defender-windows)

Mac's do not need any antivirus installed to set up; it is built in to macOS.

## Email

Your personal email account holds the keys to your online life, and will be the primary target for attackers.
- Use Gmail for your personal email, and Chrome as your web browser.

- Don’t have sensitive conversations over email. Use WhatsApp (see below).

- Don’t give any apps permissions to read or write your email inbox.

- **Make sure your email is protected with by multi factor authentication.**
    - If you can afford to purchase a [security key (£20, 
recommended)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Security-Key-USB-Authentication/dp/B07BYSB7FK/) and follow [instructions here](https://techsolidarity.org/resources/security_key_gmail.htm) to set it up.
     _If you're planning on buying more than Security Key, it is probably cheaper to order them directly from the company, [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico)_
    - Otherwise, use app-based multi factor authentication; [click here and follow this guide](https://authy.com/guides/gmail/)

## Attachments

Attachments are one of the biggest risks you face. Even attachments coming from a trusted sender are a danger; if someone you know gets their email hacked, the attacker may send you a message that looks just like a typical message, but actually contains a malicious payload (for example, an email from your campaign manager with a Word doc that actually installs a virus).

Here is the hierarchy of attachment safety, from safest to most risky:

1. Safest is to open them on an iPhone
1. Save them directly to Google Drive from Gmail. If you hover over an attachment in Gmail, you’ll see a ‘save in Google Drive’ icon. Open them in Google Drive
1. Download them to disk, and upload them to Google Drive in your browser.  Make sure you delete the downloaded file, so you don’t accidentally double-click it in the future.

The least safe way to open an attachment is to double-click it on your laptop.  **Never do this.**


## Sharing Files

- Get out of the habit of sending attachments. Instead, send links to a Google document.

- Don’t use file sharing services like Dropbox or Evernote. Stick to Google Drive.

## Phone

- Given the choice, use an iPhone over Android.

- Uninstall apps you are not regularly using; if you need them again you can always reinstall them.

- Limit apps' permissions to the minimum possible.
    - If an app asks for lots of unexplained permissions, uninstall it (do you really want a flashlight app that needs access to your camera, messages & contacts?)

- Make sure you have at least a 4-digit key code or passphrase 
    - Avoid using dates in your passcode.
    - 6 digits is better than 4; the number of possible codes goes from 10,000 to 1,000,000!

### iPhone

- Your phone needs to be receiving software updates from its manufacturer; at publication all iPhones newer than model 6 meet this.

Your iPhone is the most secure device you have. Do whatever work you can on it. It is always better to read email, use Signal, and surf the web on your phone.

TouchID/FaceID is safe to use, but Siri is not. Siri can reveal information about your contacts even when the phone is locked.

### Android:

- Your phone *needs* to be receiving software updates from its manufacturer.

- **Do not sideload apps**. This bypasses many security protections Google put in place to protect Android phones, and is a HUGE infection vector.

## Passwords
- Install and use a password manager on all your devices. [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) offers a free version which lets you generate secure passwords and share them securely between your devices.

- **Don’t reuse the same passwords** (or similar passwords) across sites
    - Most successful hijacks are done by trying people's passwords from another, poorly secured website.
- Use the password manager to create long, unique and completely random passwords which are automatically entered in to the password field.

- For your "master" password, create a long memorable passphrase rather than a short, random and hard-to-remember password.
    - [Consider this comic](https://xkcd.com/936/).
    - Combined with Multi-Factor Authentication this will make for a very secure password store.

- Use LastPass' [Security Challenge](https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/lastpass-security-challenge/) regularly

- Move all your critical account passwords (email/Facebook/Twitter/etc.) to LastPass stored/generated ones.
    - Progressively move other accounts over to LastPass as you log in to them naturally.

## Laptop

Remember that your phone is always more secure than your laptop.

- Never put USB drives (flash drives) in your computer. This is an extremely common attack route. Plugging anything into a USB port is high risk.

If you have a Windows laptop, make sure it’s running Windows 10.

Enable full disk encryption:

#### If you have Windows 10 Home:

1. Go to: Start > Settings > System > Security > Device Encryption

1. Click `Turn on`
    -  If it’s not there or greyed out, your computer does not support the limited encryption feature that Home supports.

#### If you have Windows 10 Pro:

1. Right-click on Start > Control Panel > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Turn on BitLocker
    - If it says you don’t have a TPM, [here’s how to use BitLocker without a TPM](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6229/how-to-use-bitlocker-on-drives-without-tpm/)

#### If you have a Mac:

- [Click here and follow this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837)


### Other kinds of computers
- If possible, consider getting a Chromebook.
    - This is a simplified computer, far more secure than an ordinary laptop, that can only run the Chrome browser.
    - If all you will be doing is managing emails, browsing websites & writing documents in Google Docs, it will easily suffice.

## Text Messages

- Use WhatsApp for sending text messages, and for group chat.

- **Avoid SMS (regular text messages)** or iMessage for private messaging.
    - If you must use Facebook Messenger, make sure to turn on private conversations.

- Treat Twitter public forum
    - (Even if you use the private message features)

## Facebook

- Turn on two-factor authentication in Facebook.
    - If you have a security key (£20, see above) [click here and follow this guide](https://techsolidarity.org/resources/security_key_facebook.htm)
    - Otherwise, [click here and follow this guide]( https://authy.com/guides/facebook/) for app-based MFA:

- Take your phone number off your Facebook account.

## Twitter

- Assume that anything you say in Twitter direct messages will one day be public.

- Turn on two-factor authentication in Twitter
    - If you have a security key (see above), [click here and follow this guide](https://techsolidarity.org/resources/security_key_twitter.html)
    - Otherwise, [click here and follow this guide](https://authy.com/guides/twitter/)

## Multi-Factor Authentication

- If you haven't already, install [Authy](https://authy.com/) on your phone and follow [their guides](https://authy.com/guides/) to set up any other online accounts you have
    - Sometimes this is referred to as TOTP, 2FA, MFA or "Google Authenticator". You will scan a 2D barcode and then the app will create new six-digit codes every 60 seconds. The Security Key we [recommended earlier](relative link) is the most secure form of this.
    - Not all accounts support security keys, so use follow the Authy guides for them.
    - Set up LastPass using [this guide](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/enable-multifactor-authentication-lp010002)

**Multi-Factor Authentication and a Password manager makes it so hard to break in to your online accounts most attackers would just give up!**


## Browser

- Use Google Chrome as your default browser on your laptop.

- On your iPhone, use Safari.

- On your Android, use Chrome.

- Install and use the [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) browser extension.
- Install and use the  [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en) Chrome browser extensions.
- Avoid using other extensions, as they have access to your browsing activity .

- Make a habit of using incognito mode.

- If you are visiting websites that you feel are particularly dodgy, consider using a Chromebook for the purpose, or your phone.


## Slack

- Treat Slack messages like they will enter the public domain in the future
    - (Even if you use the private message features)

- It’s fine to use Slack for coordinating and organizing, _but be mindful of the conversations you have there._ Move private discussions to Whatsapp.

## Wi-Fi

- If you do not own the Wi-Fi (e.g. you are in a cafe or hotel), then you shouldn't trust it.

**Do not use Wi-Fi you cannot trust**.

- If you must get online, use your mobile phone's 4G connection instead. Either:
    - browse directly from the mobile phone
    - create a Wi-Fi hotspot which you can connect your other device to. *Use a long password for any Wi-Fi hotspots you create.*

# Going Further
**This section is not required for most activists**.

But: it is **recommended for PPCs and their immediate teams**. 

Even if you do not fall into that category, you will benefit from doing this. We have placed it into a separate section because the biggest gains in security come from the instructions above.

## Google Advanced Protection
- **Set up Google Advanced Protection**
    - [follow the instructions here](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/).
    - In order to do this you will need two Security Keys; [these cost around £20](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Security-Key-USB-Authentication/dp/B07BYSB7FK/).
As before, if you're planning on buying more than 1, it is probably cheaper to order them directly from the company, [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico)

## Text Messages
- Use [Signal](https://www.signal.org/download/) from Open Whisper Systems wherever possible.
    - WhatsApp and Signal offer identical protection of your message content, but with WhatsApp Facebook will know everything about who you messaged and when. For this reason, we recommend upgrading to Signal.

## Password Managers
For individual use, Lastpass' free tier is a fantastic offering, but offers no good way of sharing passwords between teammembers or families; to get this you will need to use a paid product. 
For use across your entire family, [1Password's Family](https://1password.com/families/) is excellent.

## Increased Windows 10 Security
UAC is an extremely useful security tool that comes with Windows 10. By default it is set to level 3 (out of 4). By setting it to 4 you will ask Windows to alert you any time something attempts to make a system change. **This will warn you if a virus tries to act as an administrator**.

1. Click on the Windows icon in the start bar, and type `Change User Account Control settings`.
1. A window should open with a slider; slide it to the top (`Always notify`), and click `Okay`. 
1. Your screen will dim and you will get a prompt asking if you want to allow changes to be made to your device. _This is the kind of alert you will see from now on._
1. Click `Yes`.

## Anti-Virus

The benefit of running commercial antivirus software is marginal at best. The built in Windows Defender consistently rates as the best anti virus software around.
Uninstall your antivirus software and enable Windows Defender.

**Only do this if you own the device, not on a computer owned or maintained by your employer**
