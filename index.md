title: Security advice for Lib Dem Activists
---

# Why you should follow this advice

Remember that as a **political activist of any kind** you are at high risk. The guidelines below are intended to protect you against the kind of threats we have seen historically.

The good news is, if you follow these guidelines, you will have a high level of protection against [experiencing what Dr. Liz did](https://twitter.com/EvendenKenyon/status/1156223496017440768) (Dr. Liz is our candidate in Uxbridge and South Ruislip).

The easiest way to get this protection is to form good security habits before you need them.

# How to use this guide
This guide is a prescriptive list of things we recommend. It doesn't leave space for edge cases or "customisation" so take it at face value. We have put our reasoning in a second document, [here](why.html), which will allow you to customise it for your needs if you feel confident.

This advice should be easy to use for most people.

# Hardware
## Phone
Your phone will probably be the most secure device available - it's also always with you, meaning it's less likely to be compromised (or stolen) while you're away from it.

If in doubt, do it on your phone.

### Choosing a new phone
- If you can afford it, get an iPhone, they're generally more secure and much easier to keep secure
- If you cannot afford an iPhone or strongly prefer Android phones, buy a phone from the [Android One](https://www.android.com/intl/en_uk/one/) or [Android Go](https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/) range since they get regular updates directly from Google

### Updates
You _must_ make sure it's still getting updates from your manufacturer - any criminal worth their salt will be using exploits that target old bugs that have since been fixed.

#### iPhone
- If you have an iPhone 6S, 6S Plus or SE (or newer) you are [currently still getting updates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone#History_and_availability)
- The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (and older models) are out of support. **Stop using these phones, upgrade**
- Ensure you have the latest update. Do this by going to `Settings > General > Software Update`, tap `Download and Install`, then `Install`. Or [follow this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204204)

#### Android
- It's much more complicated to find out if an Android phone is getting regular updates, and can be affected by both your phone manufacturer and network. Contact your manufacturer
- Ensure you have the latest update. Do this by going to `Settings > System > Advanced > System Update`, tap `Check for Update`. These instructions may vary from phone to phone

### Backups
Without backups, if you lose or break your phone (or it breaks itself) you lose everything on your phone.

#### iPhone
- Backups are done through iCloud and will probably mean you have to [buy a plan](https://www.apple.com/uk/icloud/). 50GB (more than enough storage) is £0.79/month - do it
- Go to `Settings > <your name> > iCloud > Backup` and turn on `iCloud Backup`
- Make sure you connect your phone to your home Wi-Fi and leave it on charge overnight
- Periodically check back to see that backups are completing

#### Android
- Backups are done through Google One and you _will_ have to [buy a plan](https://one.google.com/about). 100GB (more than enough storage) is £1.59/month - do it
- Install the [Google One](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.subscriptions.red) app
- Open the Google One app, go to `Settings > Manage backup settings` and tick everything except `Back up using mobile data`
- Make sure you connect your phone to your home Wi-Fi and leave it on charge overnight
- Periodically check the `Home` tab of the Google One app to see that backups are completing


### Misc
- Go through your phone and delete any apps you're not currently using. Every app is a vector for attack; less apps are more safe. If you think you *might* need it in future, you can always reinstall when the need arises
- Consider resetting your phone back to factory settings:
  - This is a very effective way of clearing up your device (because it deletes everything)
  - It is also a good opportunity to test your backups (better now than in the heat of a campaign)
- Limit apps' permissions to the minimum possible. If in doubt, remove the permission from the app and see what breaks - you can always give it back!
  - On iPhone go to `Settings > Privacy` and go through each category in turn
  - On Android go to `Settings > Privacy > Permission manager` and go through each category in turn
- **Never sideload apps**. This is where applications are installed by downloading a file ending `.apk` instead of installing it from the app store/play store. It is disabled by default on both Android and iPhones
- **Do not root or jailbeak your device**. This disables many of the security protections on your device


### Unlocking your phone
- Ensure you use a strong, long passphrase or pin on your phone (even with fingerprint or Face ID)
  - **Don't share this with anyone**, and if you do then reset it afterwards
- Face ID and fingerprint unlocking _is_ safe, but remember the risks:
  - Face ID can be unlocked by another person pointing your phone at you before running off
  - Fingerprint unlock can be used by someone touching your phone to your finger while you're asleep (e.g. on a flight)
  - You can temporarily disable this on most phones, forcing a PIN unlock:
    - On iPhones (8 and up) hold down the side button and either volume button for two seconds
    - On iPhones (7 and below) press the power button five times
    - On Android this needs Enabling first. Go to `Settings > Display > Advanced > Lock screen display` and enable `Show lockdown option`. Then after you lock your phone, press and hold the power button until the menu comes up and tap `lockdown`

## Computer
Computers are often much less secure, especially Windows computers. Generally, avoid using a computer for confidential information where possible (though for many things this is not practical).

### Choosing a new computer
- If you don't need to use a specific Windows application (e.g. Pageplus) then **buy a Chromebook**. These are _very_ secure, but check the limitations
  - [Check to see](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en) when auto-updates end on the chromebook you plan on buying (5 years after the computer first went on sale). Once they end you will need a new one
- If you must use applications like PagePlus then you'll need a Windows computer
- Macs, though generally more secure than Windows computers, are less secure than Chromebooks and they work with less software than Windows

### Updates
Updates are _essential_ to ensuring your computer stays at least somewhat secure - any criminal worth their salt will be using exploits that target old bugs that have since been fixed.

#### Chromebook
- Chromebooks get five years of updates from the day the computer went on sale
- You will get update notifications and it will auto-update
- Updates are usually completed in minutes
- When support runs out you will get a notification to tell you - _stop using it and buy a new one_

#### Windows
- All computers _must_ be running Windows 10 and Windows update _must_ be enabled
  - Check your Windows version [using this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running)
  - Check Windows updates using [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027667/windows-10-update)
- Don't ignore update notifications, save your work and follow the instructions
  - Yes, they can take a long time. It doesn't matter. Update to stay safe

#### Mac
- All Macs _must_ be running macOS the newest version of macOS and updates _must_ be enabled
  - Check your macOS version [using this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/mac-help/mchlpx1065/10.14/mac/10.14)
  - Check automatic updates are enabled using [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/mac-help/mchlpx1065/10.14/mac/10.14)
- Don't ignore update notifications, save your work and follow the instructions
  - Yes, they can take a long time. It doesn't matter. Update to stay safe


### Backups
Without backups, if your computer goes missing or goes wrong you will lose everything.

#### Chromebook
- Chromebooks are automatically backed up for ChromeOS applications, with the important exception of the `Downloads` folder
- If your Chromebook supports Android applications (and you're using them) you can use the Android backup instructions to back them up

#### Windows & Mac
- Backing up a Windows or Mac machine is more complex
  - There's often too much data to do it online
  - This means you may need to buy new hardware
  - It also makes automated backups harder
- Avoid having to back up:
  - Do everything in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/)
  - Install [Google Backup and Sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)
  - Ensure everything you can't do in Google Chrome (e.g. PagePlus documents) is sync'd to Google Drive using Google Backup and Sync

### Encryption
It's imperative that your computers are encrypted - if you don't do this, someone can simply bypass login and pick files straight off your computer:
- Chromebooks are encrypted by default
- On Windows, follow [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption). You might have to upgrade to the Pro version of Windows 10. If so, do it
- On a Mac, enable FileVault using [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837)

### Antivirus
- On Chromebooks antivirus is built-in
- On a Mac antivirus is built-in
- On Windows 10 antivirus is now built-in, make sure it's enabled using [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/turn-on-defender-windows)
- Delete any other antivirus products

### Browser
- Use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as your default browser on your laptop (On Chromebook this is already the default)
- Install and use the [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) browser extension
  - This blocks adverts and other scripts on websites that can do bad things
- Install and use the  [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en) Chrome browser extensions
  - This forces sites to be more secure where possible 
- Avoid using other extensions, as they have access to your browsing activity
- Use incognito mode whenever you want your browsing history to not be logged
  - Remember, incognito mode will **not** stop your ISP or anyone else logging your browsing history. It just stops it being saved locally on your computer


### Misc
- Chromebooks being cluttered can't really harm you. If you run out of space, delete stuff
- On Windows and Mac, be sure to delete apps you don't use and/or are of dubious origin
- If you have a Windows PC, I recommend rebuilding it regularly:
  - This is a very effective way of clearing up your device (because it deletes everything)
  - It is also a good opportunity to test your backups (better now than in the heat of a campaign)
  - Find a friendly local computer helper to help you with this
- If you have a problem with a Mac, go to the local Apple store - it's free IT support
- _Never_ use USB drives (flash drives) - use Google Drive instead
- **ALWAYS** lock your computer when you step away from it, even if its only for a few seconds
    - On Chromebook: `[Search Key]` + `L`
    - On Windows: press `[Windows Key]` + `L`
    - On Mac: 
        - Set your Mac to [require a password _immediately_ after being locked or put to sleep](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2270/mac)
        - Lock it using a shortcut, described [here](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/lock-mac-3639053/)

# Communications
We need to talk, to collaborate and organise - and this will be taken advantage of by malicious actors (opponents, journalists, mischief-makers).

## Face to face
Face to face communication can seem secure since there's nothing recording you. There might be.
- Lower your voice. If you're in a bar or public area, assume someone's eavesdropping
- Some people record their conversations with their phone, without admitting to it, so assume they are
- For confidential conversations retire to a private space and ask people to ensure they're not recording

(You may think this is weird but I've recently noticed one of our local party executive members has been recording all our meetings with his phone, so that he can take notes later. He doesn't tell anyone he's doing that, nor do we know how carefully he handles/disposes of those recordings)

## Phone calls
Phone calls are perfect for remotely sharing information without it being recorded (usually).
- Before speaking to someone, ask them if they're on loudspeaker or in earshot of anyone else
- Some people will use call recording applications on their phones, so assume they are

## WhatsApp

[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) is the most secure messenger service _you_ will use. A few others are _technically_ more secure but WhatsApp is so pervasive that you probably have it installed on your phone already, and so does the person you want to talk to.

- Always have conversations on WhatsApp - never use SMS/Email/etc for internal communications
- Make sure messages only go to people that need to see them
  - Don't send out confidential information to groups of volunteers when only a few specific people need that information
  - Leaks from members (in the pub, boasting to journalists, etc) are common
- **Don't write anything down you can't risk leaking**
  - Leaks happen. Screenshots, stolen phones, aggrieved colleagues
  - Phone them instead
- On computers, use the [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com/) interface
  - _Always_ log out afterwards, or someone else can use your computer to see your messages

## Email
Email is _very insecure_. Unfortunately it's also very important. Never use it for anything that needs to be kept secret unless you have to.
- Use Gmail for your personal email
  - Install the Gmail app on your phone
  - Install Google Chrome on your computer
  - _Never_ access Gmail using anything else
- _Never_ use email for confidential information (use WhatsApp instead)
- _Never_ share documents/files through email (use Google Drive instead)
- _Never_ give any apps permissions to read or write your email inbox

### Attachments
Attachments are one of the biggest risks you face. Even attachments coming from a trusted sender are a danger; if someone you know gets their email hacked, the attacker may send you a message that looks just like a typical message, but actually contains a malicious payload (for example, an email from your campaign manager with a Word doc that actually installs a virus).

- Avoid sending attachments (use Google Drive instead)
- Encourage your team to use Google Drive to share documents
- Default to opening attachments on your phone instead of your computer
- Where necessary to open it on a computer, make sure not to click any "Administrator" prompts
- If the attachment doesn't open as expected or something weird happens, shut down the computer and find your friendly local computer helper


# Data
We need to share data, and this should be broken down in to three categories:
- Protected (voter data etc)
- Classified (campaign plans etc)
- Unclassified (poster files etc)

## Protected Data
Any data about a voter is protected by both the Data Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation.
- Store and edit this data in the following tools _only_:
  - Connect/MiniVAN
  - Salesforce
  - Nationbuilder
  - Foci2 (Prater Raines)
  - Mailchimp (only if properly authorised)
- _Never_ extract or store data outside of these products
  - If you do you may be breaking the law!

## Classified Data
Any data that you don't want to get in to a rival's hands (or the press) must be kept safe and shared carefully.
- Use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to store data
- Use the sharing feature to share specific documents and folders with specific people
  - When sharing, ensure that only `Specific people can access` is set
  - Ensure you tick `Prevent editors from changing access and adding new people`
  - Remember that when you share a folder, the whole contents will be shared with everyone on the list
  - Periodically check share lists and prune accordingly
  - Only share with the smallest number of people who _need_ access
- Avoid printing data
  - Buy a shredder
  - Shred everything you print
- _Never_ share data using email

## Unclassified Data
Any data that isn't sensitive can be given a wider reach.
- Use [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) to store data
- Use the sharing feature to create a "shared" folder and share with anyone you like
  - _Ensure Classified and Unclassified data are kept in separate folders!_
- Additionally, feel free to share this data via email or Facebook or anything else

# Security
## Passwords
Weak passwords are a common way of breaking in to computers. Most passwords under 8 characters can be broken in minutes, some in seconds.

- Install [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) on your phone and in Chrome
- Add all your usernames and passwords to LastPass
- Use the password generator to create random, unique replacement passwords for all sites
- Use the [LastPass Security Challenge](https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/lastpass-security-challenge/) to check your passwords are secure
- Use a [passphrase](https://xkcd.com/936/) for your master password:
  - Choose four or more random words (e.g. battery, horse, staple, correct)
    - Ensure they're actually random, they can't be a cogent sentence
    - Try flipping through a book and picking words at random
    - Avoid common words like conjunctives (and, or, etc)
  - Piece them together in to a single phrase with capital letters (`BatteryHorseStapleCorrect`)
  - Add some numbers and/or punctuation (`BatteryHorseStaple?Correct!`)
  - Keep logging in and out of LastPass until you remember the password automatically
- **Don’t reuse the same passwords** (or similar passwords) across sites
    - Most successful hijacks are done by trying taking people's passwords from one hacked website, and trying them on every single other website they can find.```

## PINs
PINs are very insecure since there are much less combinations of numbers to try than there are letters.
- If you can, use a longer PIN. 6 numbers is better than 4
- Don't use dates, they are the first thing people will try
- Use a PIN phrase:
  - Choose a word that's longer than your PIN
  - Type that word out using the letters on a number pad
  - This is easier to remember and much more secure

## Multi-Factor Authentication
Using a username, password, and something else is much more secure than just a username and password.
- Install `Authy` on your phone and go through the setup process
  - Remember to store your Authy Username/Password in LastPass
- Set up all your online accounts with 2FA using [this guide](https://authy.com/guides/)
    - If you find yourself short of time, set it up first for your email addresses, Facebook, & Twitter accounts **at a bare minimum**.
- When you log in with your username and password, you will additionally have to enter a number from the `Authy` app on your phone in future

## Logging out
- _Always_ log out of a website when you've finished using it on your computer
- _Never_ leave Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter or anything else logged in
  - Even if it's your own computer

## Wi-Fi
If you do not own the Wi-Fi (e.g. you are in a cafe or hotel), then you shouldn't trust it.
- Only use trusted Wi-Fi networks (your home, your office, etc)
  - Other Wi-Fi networks may track and steal your data
  - Other people on the same Wi-Fi network could track and steal your data
- Otherwise, use your phone
  - Browse directly from the mobile phone, or
  - Create a Wi-Fi hotspot which you can connect your other device to
    - On iPhone, [follow this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204023)
    - On Android, follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9059108)
    - *Use a long password for any Wi-Fi hotspots you create*

# Online Presence
It's important to be active online, but it's also dangerous. If someone compromises your account and writes something nasty pretending to be you, you'll have to spend precious campaign time trying to explain that it wasn't you. Don't fall victim.

## Facebook
- [Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication in Facebook](https://authy.com/guides/facebook/)
- Ensure you have a strong, unique password stored in LastPass
- Only use Facebook for unclassified data
  - Facebook is designed for sharing, not privacy
  - There is no way to validate members on Facebook
  - You must assume there are non-members, ex-members and rival party members pretending to be members in any private group
- Treat every part of Facebook like a public forum
- Take time to go through your [Activity Log](https://www.facebook.com/help/289066827791446)
  - Not only old posts and pictures, but also liked pages etc
  - Everyone has something embarrassing on their Facebook account
  - Limiting your posts to friends isn't enough, make sure they're deleted!


## Twitter
- [Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication in Twitter](https://authy.com/guides/twitter/)
- Ensure you have a strong, unique password stored in LastPass
- Assume that anything you say in Twitter direct messages will one day be public
- Take time to go through your past tweets and replies for embarrassing or compromising messages
